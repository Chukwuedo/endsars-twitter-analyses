# endsars-twitter-analyses
This project is to analyse the #endsars movement. I believe that this movement was one of the most powerful movements in Africa over the last two decades.

I aim to focus on the following in this project.

1. Location analysis to identify the potential reach locally and internationally
2. Key words and most popular terms used during the movement
3. Key influencers and proponents involved in the movement
4. Trend of tweets (peak periods and off peak)
5. Sentiment analyses of sample tweets (10k - 50k)
